 ### 2020, Intelligent washing water saving system based on turbidity detection (with Yu Chen)
* Laundry wastewater is recycled and purified by classification: The relatively clean rinsing water and dehydrated water are collected through real-time purification treatment and participate in the washing process again.
* Intelligent control of laundry time and water consumption: The gravity sensor is used to determine the initial time and water use as well as the time of dehydration. The turbidity detection sensor is used to collect the water quality data of the previous process, and through the fuzzy control principle, the appropriate time for the next process is calculated to achieve the purpose of saving water and energy.

 ### 2019-pres, Laser printing of UV curing materials
* Focus on the improvement of printing resolution and 3D micro-structure (microfluidic channel, micro-lens array) processing.
* Using time resolved imaging.

 ### 2018-pres, Teeth composition detection by temporally shaped fs-LIBS


* Using basic machine learning method (PCA, PLS-DA) to do dimensionality reduction and classification of the original laser induced breakdown spectrum data for three different dental compositions, and to predict the unknown tooth composition.
* The accuracy of the established classification detection model is more than 97.7% and the model is also reliable in predicting unknown data.

 ### Data Processing

* Origin, Matlab

 ### 2018, Design of robot grasping structure for box cargo
* Undergraduate graduation project at Central South University
* The structural design is aimed at reducing the gap during stacking of mechanical arms, and the structure is optimized by finite element analysis (FEA) under the condition of safety, so as to carry out the lightweight design.
* The stacking gap can be controlled at 11mm.
