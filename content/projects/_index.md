 ### 2020, Intelligent washing water saving system based on turbidity detection (with Yu Chen)

 ### 2019-pres, Laser printing of UV curing materials
* Focus on the improvement of printing resolution and 3D micro-structure (microfluidic channel, micro-lens array) processing.
* Using time resolved imaging.

 ### 2018-pres, Teeth composition detection by temporally shaped fs-LIBS


* Using basic machine learning method (PCA, PLS-DA) to do dimensionality reduction and classification of the original laser induced breakdown spectrum data for three different dental compositions, and to predict the unknown tooth composition.
* The accuracy of the established classification detection model is more than 97.7% and the model is also reliable in predicting unknown data.

 ### Data Processing

* Origin, Matlab

 ### 2018, Design of robot grasping structure for box cargo
* Undergraduate graduation project at Central South University
* The structural design is aimed at reducing the gap during stacking of mechanical arms, and the structure is optimized by finite element analysis (FEA) under the condition of safety, so as to carry out the lightweight design.
* The stacking gap can be controlled at 11mm.
