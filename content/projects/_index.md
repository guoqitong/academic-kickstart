 ### Teeth composition detection by temporally shaped fs-LIBS


* Using basic machine learning method (PCA, PLS-DA) to do dimensionality reduction and classification of the original laser induced breakdown spectrum data for three different dental compositions, and to predict the unknown tooth composition.
* The accuracy of the established classification detection model is more than 97.7% and the model is also reliable in predicting unknown data.
 ### Data Processing

* Origin, Matlab

 ### Electronic design and Simulation

* Keil C51, Arduino, Multisim, Proteus

 ### Central South University Formula Racing Team/Electric

* Worked in the electrical department, responsible for driving motor control, signal and power cable connection, design of water-cooling system and battery box, sensor selection.
